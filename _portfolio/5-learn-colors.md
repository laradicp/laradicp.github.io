Project aimed at teaching the colors to toddlers through a game.

Objects of different colors are displayed at each corner of the screen, and another one at the center. The player needs to select, by holding something yellow (or of another color, if the parameters are adjusted) to identify their hand, the object with the same color as the one at the center. After a succesful match, the respective color is announced by sound.

I worked on the color recognition by OpenCV and defined the positioning of the objects in the screen.
