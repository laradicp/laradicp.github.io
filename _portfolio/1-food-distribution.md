Ongoing project to optimize the distribution of food that would potentially be wasted to small businesses and non-governmental organizations.

Food providers, such as supermarkets and manufacturers, do not manage to sell all of their goods far enough from the expiration date, thus generating wastage. On the other hand, many people suffer from food insecurity in Brazil, while hunger is also a worldwide concern.

This work will develop a decision support system responsible for optimizing the distribution of food that will not be commercialized by ordinary means, but sold at low prices or donated, to a network of institutions capable of consuming it in a short period of time.

I care much about driving social impact, and this project is aligned with the reduction of food waste at the same time that is able to bring more food security to vulnerable populations.
