Project developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to detect, capture and notify people without mask or wearing it incorrectly.

We used YOLOv5 for the mask detection by training the model with databases of people wearing or not masks, correctly and incorretly. I mainly worked on the Telegram bot, responsible for capturing and notifying transgressions, and integrated it with YOLOv5.

The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Felipehonorato1/mask_detection).
