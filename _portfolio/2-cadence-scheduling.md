Project inspired by a large multinational automotive company, which imposes cadences in the assembly line when manufacturing their cars, so the ones with more demanding features are not scheduled in close proximity to each other. This problem is new in the literature, and it's feasibility version is proven to be strongly NP-complete. As the first author of the paper, I worked on the mathematical formulation of the problem, developed lower and upper combinatorial bounds for it, and implemented the exact and heuristic algorithms used in the solution. The companyâ€™s needs are solved to optimality in less than a second, while manual approaches take hours to produce a schedule and still violate the spacing constraints an average of 16 times per instance.
