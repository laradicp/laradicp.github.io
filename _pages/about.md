I am a Computer Engineering student at [Universidade Federal da Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br/) (UFPB) and an undergraduate researcher at the Logistics & Optimization Group from the [Laboratory of Systems Engineering and Robotics](https://laser.ci.ufpb.br/) under the supervision of [Prof. Anand Subramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandsubraman/). I am passionate about solving complex problems with real-life applications, thus the fields of prescriptive analytics and operations research (OR) are fascinating to me.

My main research project, the assembly line scheduling of a multinational automotive company, was awarded the Best Undergraduate Work at the [Brazilian OR Conference](https://sbpo2021.galoa.com.br/) in 2021. Also, I am a Tech Fellow at [Fundação Estudar](https://www.estudar.org.br/), a merit scholarship to support the education of high-performing Brazilian students in tech.

My ambition is to impact the society I live in and make a positive difference in the world.
