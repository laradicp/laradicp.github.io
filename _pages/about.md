I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at Universidade Federal da Paraíba (UFPB). I focus on optimization and operations research (OR) for my scientific production, since I am passionate about solving complex problems with real-life applications. My main research project, the assembly line scheduling of a multinational automotive company, was awarded the Best Undergraduate Work at the <u><a href="{{https://sbpo2021.galoa.com.br/}}">Brazilian OR Conference</a></u> in 2021. Also, I am a Tech Fellow at Fundação Estudar, a merit scholarship to support the education of high-performing Brazilian students in tech. My ambition is to impact the society I live in and make a positive difference in the world.
