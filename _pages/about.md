I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas](https://dbertsim.mit.edu) at the [Operations Research Center (ORC)](https://orc.mit.edu) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu). I work in optimization and artificial inteligence applied to healthcare.

I graduated with my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (_cum laude_) at the [Universidade Federal da Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br/) (UFPB). There, I conducted research at the Logistics & Optimization Group from the [Laboratory of Systems Engineering and Robotics](https://laser.ci.ufpb.br/) under the supervision of [Prof. Anand Subramanian](https://ci.ufpb.br/anand).

Also, I am a Fellow at [Fundação Estudar](https://www.estudar.org.br/), a merit scholarship to support the education of high-performing Brazilian students.

My ambition is to impact the society I live in and make a positive difference in the world.
