I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at [Universidade Federal da Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br/) (UFPB). I focus on optimization and operations research (OR) for my scientific production, since I am passionate about solving complex problems with real-life applications.

My main research project, the assembly line scheduling of a multinational automotive company, was awarded the Best Undergraduate Work at the [Brazilian OR Conference](https://sbpo2021.galoa.com.br/) in 2021. Also, I am a Tech Fellow at [Fundação Estudar](https://www.estudar.org.br/), a merit scholarship to support the education of high-performing Brazilian students in tech.

My ambition is to impact the society I live in and make a positive difference in the world.
