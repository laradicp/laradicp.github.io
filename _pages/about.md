I graduated with my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (_cum laude_) at the [Universidade Federal da Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br/) (UFPB) and I work as a research assistant at the Logistics & Optimization Group from the [Laboratory of Systems Engineering and Robotics](https://laser.ci.ufpb.br/) under the supervision of [Prof. Anand Subramanian](https://ci.ufpb.br/anand). I am passionate about solving complex problems with real-life applications, thus the fields of prescriptive analytics and operations research (OR) are fascinating to me.

My main research project, the assembly line scheduling of a multinational automotive company, was awarded the Best Undergraduate Work at the [Brazilian OR Conference](https://sbpo2021.galoa.com.br/) in 2021 and is a finalist at the [INFORMS Undergraduate OR Prize](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Undergraduate-Operations-Research-Prize). Also, I am a Tech Fellow at [Fundação Estudar](https://www.estudar.org.br/), a merit scholarship to support the education of high-performing Brazilian students in tech.

My ambition is to impact the society I live in and make a positive difference in the world.
